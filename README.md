 ## Code? OK
 Let me give you some context: <br />
 In order to test and develop the main idea is to create a Restaurant Menú dynamically, fully administrable. <br />

Here you will find some projects based on that great idea 💡 <br />
You can find a web site, the app with REACT and Firebase or a Backend in NODE JS, Express with a **__lot of libraries__** and MongoDB.<br />
<br />


🌱 I'm working on the full implementation with .NET Core 6 and REACT. 
💬 Want to tell me something?
